# vLLM-Omni Performance Tuning

## Overview

vLLM-Omni provides multiple optimization levers for both autoregressive and diffusion pipelines. Key techniques include KV cache optimization (inherited from vLLM), TeaCache/Cache-DiT for diffusion acceleration, quantization, CPU offloading, and parallelism configuration.

## Optimization Quick Reference

| Technique | Applies To | Speedup | Quality Impact |
|-----------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| TeaCache | Diffusion models | 1.5-2.0x | Minimal |
| Cache-DiT | Diffusion models | 1.3-1.8x | Minimal |
| Quantization | All models | 1.2-1.5x | Slight |
| Tensor Parallelism | All models | Near-linear | None |
| Sequence Parallelism | DiT models | Near-linear | None |
| CPU Offloading | All models | Enables larger models | Adds latency |
| GPU Memory Tuning | All models | More throughput | None |
| Multi-Thread Weight Loading | Diffusion models | Faster startup | None |

## TeaCache (Diffusion Acceleration)

TeaCache provides adaptive caching for diffusion transformer denoising steps, skipping redundant computations:

```bash
vllm serve <model> --omni \
  --enable-teacache \
  --teacache-threshold 0.1
```

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `--enable-teacache` | Enable TeaCache | Disabled |
| `--teacache-threshold` | Cache hit threshold (lower = more caching) | Model-specific |

Recommended thresholds by model:
- Image models: 0.05-0.15
- Video models: 0.08-0.20

## Cache-DiT

Alternative diffusion acceleration backend:

```bash
vllm serve <model> --omni --enable-cache-dit
```

Can be combined with TeaCache, but test independently first to measure impact.

## Quantization

For full quantization guidance (method selection, AWQ/GPTQ workflows, FP8 KV cache, quality verification), see the dedicated **[vllm-omni-quantization](../vllm-omni-quantization/SKILL.md)** skill.

## Multi-Thread Weight Loading

Diffusion models (Qwen-Image, Wan2.2, FLUX, HunyuanImage3.0, etc.) load safetensors shards in parallel using a thread pool instead of sequentially. This is enabled by default and significantly reduces cold-start time:

- Qwen-Image: ~3 min -> substantially faster
- Wan2.2-I2V 14B: ~5 min -> substantially faster

No configuration needed -- this is automatic for all diffusion models using safetensors format.

## CPU Offloading

Offload model layers to CPU RAM to fit larger models:

### Model-Level Offloading

```bash
vllm serve <model> --omni --cpu-offload-gb 10
```

Offloads approximately 10 GB of model weights to CPU. Adds latency for offloaded layers.

### Layer-Wise Offloading

For diffusion models, layer-wise offloading moves individual transformer layers to CPU between forward passes:

```bash
vllm serve <model> --omni --enable-layerwise-cpu-offload
```

## GPU Memory Configuration

Maximize throughput by tuning GPU memory allocation:

```bash
# Default: 90% of GPU memory
vllm serve <model> --omni --gpu-memory-utilization 0.9

# Conservative: 80% (leaves room for other processes)
vllm serve <model> --omni --gpu-memory-utilization 0.8

# Aggressive: 95%
vllm serve <model> --omni --gpu-memory-utilization 0.95
```

## Benchmarking

### Quick Benchmark

```bash
python -m vllm_omni.benchmarks.benchmark_serving \
  --model Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo \
  --num-prompts 100 \
  --port 8091
```

### Measuring Latency

Time a single request:

```bash
time curl -s http://localhost:8091/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "a red circle"}],
    "extra_body": {"height": 512, "width": 512, "num_inference_steps": 20}
  }' > /dev/null
```

### Monitoring During Benchmark

```bash
# GPU utilization
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi

# Server metrics
curl http://localhost:8091/metrics
```

## Optimization Workflow

1. **Baseline**: Run benchmark with default settings
2. **Memory**: Tune `--gpu-memory-utilization` to maximize without OOM
3. **Parallelism**: Add tensor parallelism if multi-GPU available
4. **Caching**: Enable TeaCache or Cache-DiT for diffusion models
5. **Quantization**: Apply if memory-constrained
6. **Offloading**: Use CPU offloading as last resort for large models
7. **Re-benchmark**: Compare against baseline

## Troubleshooting

**No speedup with TeaCache**: Threshold may be too conservative. Lower it gradually (e.g., 0.05) and check quality.

**OOM after optimization**: Quantization reduces memory. Combine with lower `gpu-memory-utilization`.

**Latency regression with TP**: For small models, the communication overhead of tensor parallelism may exceed the compute savings. Use TP only for models that saturate a single GPU.
