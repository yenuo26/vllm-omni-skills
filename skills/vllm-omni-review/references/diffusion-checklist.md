## Dimension 1: PR Body Completeness

### 1.1 Required Evidence (Table A)

| Item | What to Check | Missing → Action |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| **vLLM-Omni generation script** | Runnable Python or bash snippet using `Omni` / `vllm serve` that produces output | Request script |
| **Generated sample outputs** | At least 1 image / video / audio sample attached or linked | Request sample |
| **vLLM-Omni e2e latency** | Wall-clock time from request to output, with GPU model, count, resolution, steps | Request measurement |
| **vLLM-Omni VRAM usage** | Peak VRAM in GB during generation, with resolution / steps | Request measurement |

- [ ] **vLLM-Omni generation script present**
  - Must use `Omni(model=...)` for offline, or `vllm serve ... --omni` for online
  - Script must be runnable (no pseudocode, no placeholder `<model_id>`)
  - If only offline or only online is shown, note which is missing

- [ ] **Sample output attached or linked**
  - Image PR: at least 1 image (PNG/JPEG), ideally multiple prompts
  - Video PR: at least 1 video clip or animated GIF
  - Audio PR: audio file or spectrogram + waveform visualization
  - Resolution and generation parameters must be visible (caption or table)

- [ ] **vLLM-Omni e2e latency recorded**
  - Wall-clock time from request submission to final output received
  - Must include: GPU model, GPU count, resolution (H×W), `num_inference_steps`
  - Single measurement is acceptable; batch=1 is the baseline

- [ ] **vLLM-Omni peak VRAM recorded**
  - Peak GPU memory in GB
  - Measurement method noted (e.g., `torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()`, `nvidia-smi`)
  - Must match the hardware spec reported with latency

### 1.2 Recommended Evidence (Table B)

| Item | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| **diffusers generation script** | Reproducible baseline for quality and speed comparison |
| **diffusers sample outputs** | Side-by-side quality comparison demonstrates parity |
| **diffusers e2e latency** | Quantifies vLLM-Omni speedup relative to reference |
| **diffusers VRAM usage** | Quantifies memory reduction or overhead |

- [ ] **diffusers generation script**
  - Same prompt, same resolution, same number of steps as vLLM-Omni script
  - Uses `diffusers` library directly (not wrapped in vllm-omni)

- [ ] **diffusers sample output**
  - Side-by-side or clearly labeled comparison with vLLM-Omni output
  - Same prompt used for both

- [ ] **diffusers e2e latency**
  - Recorded under same hardware conditions as vLLM-Omni measurement
  - Speedup ratio (vLLM-Omni latency / diffusers latency) stated or calculable

- [ ] **diffusers VRAM usage**
  - Peak VRAM under same conditions
  - Delta (VRAM_vllm_omni − VRAM_diffusers) highlighted if significant


### 1.3 Canonical PR body template (gold standard)

Contributors can paste this structure into the PR description. Reviewers use it as the reference for what “complete” means for Dimension 1.

#### Measurement guidelines

##### How to measure e2e latency

**Offline:**
```python
import time
from vllm_omni.entrypoints.omni import Omni

omni = Omni(model="org/model-id")

# Warm-up (1 run, not measured)
omni.generate("warm-up prompt")

# Timed run
start = time.perf_counter()
outputs = omni.generate("a cup of coffee on a wooden table")
end = time.perf_counter()
print(f"e2e latency: {end - start:.2f}s")
```

**Online (using `curl` with timing):**
```bash
time curl -s http://localhost:8091/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "a cup of coffee"}], ...}'
```

##### How to measure peak VRAM

```python
import torch
torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()

# Run generation here

peak_mb = torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated() / 1024**2
print(f"Peak VRAM: {peak_mb / 1024:.1f} GB")
```

Or via `nvidia-smi`:
```bash
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.used --format=csv,noheader,nounits -l 1
```

##### What “same conditions” means for diffusers comparison

When comparing vLLM-Omni vs diffusers:
- Same GPU model and count
- Same prompt
- Same resolution (H × W)
- Same `num_inference_steps`
- Same `seed`
- Same data type (both BF16 or both FP16)
- Both measured after one warm-up run

---

#### Common PR body mistakes

| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| Using a tiny resolution (256×256) for latency measurement | Use the model's recommended resolution (typically 512×512 minimum, 1024×1024 for flagship models) |
| Reporting latency without warm-up run | Always warm up the model first; measure on the second+ run |
| Showing only one sample image | Show 2–3 samples with diverse prompts to demonstrate quality |
| Only demonstrating offline mode | Include both offline (`Omni`) and online (`vllm serve`) |
| Reporting VRAM from `nvidia-smi` at idle | Measure peak VRAM during active generation |
| Listing features as "planned" in the support table | Only mark ✅ for features that are implemented and tested in this PR |

---

## Dimension 2: Code Checks

### 2.1–2.2 Inference Mode Coverage (both required)

| Check | Pass Condition | Flag |
|-------|----------------|------|
| **Offline inference** | `Omni` / `OmniLLM` integration exists; model can be instantiated and called | Missing offline path |
| **Online serving** | `vllm serve` or `AsyncOmni` handles the model; API routes return correct responses | Missing online path |

### 2.1 Offline Inference

- [ ] `Omni` or `OmniLLM` can instantiate the model (`model="<hf_id>"`)
- [ ] `.generate()` returns a valid output object with images/video/audio fields
- [ ] Default stage config YAML exists under `vllm_omni/configs/` or equivalent
- [ ] Model is registered in the model registry (import path resolvable)

### 2.2 Online Serving

- [ ] `AsyncOmni` or API server route handles the model
- [ ] `vllm serve <model> --omni` startup does not error
- [ ] `/v1/chat/completions` or appropriate endpoint returns correct response schema
- [ ] Input validation rejects malformed requests with 400, not engine crash

### 2.3 Diffusers Mixin Cleanup

- [ ] No `DiffusionPipelineMixin` in added/modified code
- [ ] No `SchedulerMixin` in added/modified code
- [ ] No `ConfigMixin` (diffusers) in added/modified code
- [ ] No direct `diffusers.pipelines.*` import in production model code
  - Exception: `diffusers` may appear in test files or benchmark scripts

**Detection command:**
```bash
gh pr diff <pr_number> --repo vllm-project/vllm-omni \
  | grep -E '^\+' \
  | grep -E 'DiffusionPipelineMixin|SchedulerMixin|ConfigMixin|from diffusers\.pipelines'
```

### 2.4 Acceleration Features

At least one of the following must be implemented and demonstrably working:
