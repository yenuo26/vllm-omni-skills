# vLLM-Omni PR Review

## Overview

Review PRs like a real maintainer — direct, selective, and focused on high-signal issues. Prioritize 2-3 real problems per PR over exhaustive coverage. Most PRs should get 1-5 short comments; some just get an empty APPROVE.

Use this skill as a router for `vllm-project/vllm-omni` pull request reviews. Keep the default context small, load only the references that match the diff, and prioritize high-confidence findings over coverage theater.

## Usage modes

Inspired by common PR-review skill patterns (e.g. explicit modes + tool choice); **repo is always `vllm-project/vllm-omni`** unless the user says otherwise.

| Mode | What to do |
|------|------------|
| **No PR / branch given** | Do not start a full review. Ask for a **PR number or URL**, or **local branch** review vs `main` (or named base). |
| **PR number or URL** | Use `gh` against this repo: `gh pr view <n> --repo vllm-project/vllm-omni`, `gh pr diff <n> --repo vllm-project/vllm-omni`. Commands and JSON fields: [references/review-execution.md](references/review-execution.md). |
| **Local branch** | No GitHub PR yet: `git fetch` if needed, then `git diff <base>...HEAD`, `git diff --stat <base>...HEAD`, `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline`. Use branch name instead of PR # in the review header; same blocker scan and routing. |
| **Pre-filled prompt** | If the prompt already includes PR title/body, checks, or thread summaries (e.g. from GitHub), **do not re-fetch metadata** unless something is missing; still obtain the **diff** if not present (`gh pr diff` or `git diff` against merge base). |

**Depth:** **Default** = maintainer-style brevity ([comment budget](references/review-execution.md)). If the user asks for **detailed** / **in-depth** / **line-by-line**, add a **Specific comments** list with `path:line` items; do not duplicate those points as long prose in the review body. Still respect the usual inline ceiling unless the user explicitly wants an audit-style pass.

## What to prioritize (CI-complement)

- **Investigate, don’t guess** — If a checklist item might apply (e.g. connector lifecycle, diffusion cache), read surrounding code or use **parallel subagents** for independent areas. A wrong guess is worse than silence.
- **Focus on what automation doesn’t prove** — Design, API contracts, stage/connector invariants, test adequacy for omni paths, breaking behavior. Do not re-argue formatting or issues **pre-commit / CI already failed** (point at the gate instead).
- **Structured notes** — If you produce a multi-section writeup for the **user**, **omit sections with no findings** (no “No issues” padding).

**Parallel investigation:** Large diffs or multiple subsystems (e.g. `entrypoints/` + `engine/` + `diffusion/`) → split by directory or concern and investigate **in parallel** when subagents exist.

## Which reference to load (do not load everything)

| Situation | Open |
|-----------|------|
| Every review | [references/review-execution.md](references/review-execution.md) — gates, `gh` commands, comment budget, tone, batch/CI triage, Python style flags |
| Prefix / multi-skill / hardware guess | [references/review-routing.md](references/review-routing.md) |
| Blocker scan details + merge-blocking patterns | [references/blocker-patterns.md](references/blocker-patterns.md) — Part 1 patterns; **Part 2** = former “pitfalls” (footguns, MRO, connectors, async, etc.) |
| System layout + **code-pattern review** (async, connectors, validation, …) | [references/architecture.md](references/architecture.md) — includes “Code patterns for review” at the end |
| Diffusion / image / video model PRs | [references/diffusion-checklist.md](references/diffusion-checklist.md) |
| High-risk change; need coverage matrix / docs sync | [references/tests-docs-checklist.md](references/tests-docs-checklist.md) |
| PR has perf/accuracy claims or `[Performance]` prefix | [references/perf-verification.md](references/perf-verification.md) — claim detection, hardware-aware benchmark verification, graceful degradation |
| PR adds/modifies tests or touches core code without tests | [references/test-quality-evaluation.md](references/test-quality-evaluation.md) — assertion quality, anti-patterns, hardware-aware test execution |
| Calibrating phrasing from real maintainers | [references/maintainer-style-study.md](references/maintainer-style-study.md) |

**Legacy paths (do not load — content merged):** `pitfalls.md` → [blocker-patterns.md](references/blocker-patterns.md) **Part 2**; `code-patterns.md` → [architecture.md](references/architecture.md) **Code patterns for review**; `python-style-guide.md` → [review-execution.md](references/review-execution.md) **Python style (review flags)**; batch/CI triage → [review-execution.md](references/review-execution.md) (Batch / CI sections).

## Priority Hierarchy Under Context Pressure

If context is limited, prioritize: blocker scan → evidence → perf verification → test quality → domain routing → verdict.

Always run the blocker scan. Under context pressure, do a shallow scan of the most critical categories (Correctness, Security) and flag that the scan was incomplete.

## Core Workflow

Check whether this PR is still a draft or WIP in the PR title, if so, end the review process. 


### Step 0: Verify Review Gates First

If this is a ready-to-review PR, check the mergeability and required checks (DCO, pre-commit, mergeability). If failing, stop and ask the author to fix gates before proceeding.

For gate commands, review submission, and comment style, see [references/review-execution.md](references/review-execution.md).

Then continue with the workflow below.

### Step 1: Gather Minimal Context

Fetch:
- PR metadata and changed files
- The diff
- Linked issues for `[Bugfix]` and `[Feature]` PRs only when conventions are unclear
- Related PRs only when conventions or prior decisions are unclear

Group changes mentally by **kind** (runtime code, tests, docs, configs) to see where risk sits; then load references (Step 4) only for areas touched.

Do not fetch broad extra context unless the diff leaves real ambiguity.

### Step 2: Blocker Scan (Required First)

Execute this scan before any other review activity. For each category, explicitly mark PASS or list blocking issues found.

```
BLOCKER scan:
| Category            | Result                                  |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Correctness         | PASS / ISSUES: (list)                   |
| Reliability/Safety  | PASS / ISSUES: (list)                   |
| Breaking Changes    | PASS / (check PR description first)     |
| Test Coverage       | PASS / (check PR desc for evidence) / needs tests |
| Documentation       | PASS / ISSUES: (list)                   |
| Security            | PASS / ISSUES: (list)                   |
```

**Blocker categories:**

| Category | Flag These Patterns |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Correctness** | Silent exception swallows, uninitialized variables, off-by-one errors, logic inversions, missing returns |
| **Reliability/Safety** | Unclosed resources, race conditions, missing None checks, hardcoded timeouts, silent fallbacks |
| **Breaking Changes** | Signature changes without compat, removed public APIs, changed defaults, config removals |
| **Test Coverage** | Bug fix without regression test, new API without tests, performance claims without benchmarks |
| **Documentation** | New public API without docs, breaking changes without migration guide, new config without docs |
| **Security** | Hardcoded secrets, user input in eval/format strings, insecure deserialization |

**Evidence standard:** Code inspection suffices for code-level blockers. For test coverage, require CI logs or PR description evidence.

**Confidence threshold:** Flag obvious cases only. For suspicious but uncertain cases, add a non-blocking comment.

**Special cases:**
| PR Type | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Doc-only PRs | Skip categories 1-4 and 6, proceed to 5 (Documentation) |
| Config-only PRs | Focus on Breaking Changes + Documentation |
| Test-only PRs | Focus on Correctness of test logic |
| Draft PRs | Do not block; add a single non-blocking comment: "Ready for full review when draft status removed. Preliminary scan available on request." |

For detailed anti-patterns with code examples, see [references/blocker-patterns.md](references/blocker-patterns.md).

**If blockers found:** Track issues internally (category + file + line). Do not paste structured `BLOCKING ISSUES:` templates into the review body (see Step 6).

**If no blockers:** List non-blocking suggestions and proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3: Route to the Right Skill

Use the title prefix and changed directories to decide whether a domain skill is required. Doc-only, config-only, and test-only PRs usually skip domain skills unless the diff crosses into model or API areas.

**Full prefix table, multi-skill combos, hardware detection, and delegation triggers:** [references/review-routing.md](references/review-routing.md).

### Step 4: Load Only the Relevant Review Reference

Use **only** the files in this table. Older docs may mention `references/pitfalls.md` or `references/code-patterns.md`; those files were removed — use **Part 2** of blocker patterns and **Code patterns for review** in architecture instead.

| Diff Area                                                                                 | Load                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vllm_omni/engine/`, `vllm_omni/stages/`, `vllm_omni/connectors/`, `vllm_omni/diffusion/` | [blocker-patterns.md](references/blocker-patterns.md) **Part 2** (common pitfalls) |
| Async, distributed coordination, validation, connector behavior                           | [architecture.md](references/architecture.md) — section **Code patterns for review** (at end of file) |
| Scheduler, stage boundaries, execution model, critical paths                              | [Architecture](references/architecture.md) (full)          |
| High-risk changes (core logic, configs/params, error handling, concurrency/distributed, I/O) or `[Feature]` / `[Bugfix]` PRs | [references/tests-docs-checklist.md](references/tests-docs-checklist.md) |

Pick the narrowest references that match the diff; avoid loading every row by default.

### Step 5: Ask for Concrete Validation Evidence

When tests or benchmarks are missing **and PR description evidence is insufficient**, ask for specific evidence:

| Change Type | Minimum Evidence to Request |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| API behavior | Functional tests covering success + invalid input + response contract |
| Model execution | Inference correctness tests comparing outputs against baseline |
| Performance optimization | Benchmark showing before/after latency on stated hardware |
| New feature (performance-affecting) | Performance comparison test: baseline vs. with change (latency, throughput, VRAM) |
| Memory management | Peak memory measurement showing no regression |
| Bug fixes | Regression test that reproduces the original bug |

For `[Feature]` PRs affecting performance or `[Performance]` PRs, use the checklist in [references/tests-docs-checklist.md](references/tests-docs-checklist.md) section 5.

Be explicit in review comments. Treat "manual verification only" as insufficient unless automation is genuinely impossible.

### Step 6: Verify Perf/Accuracy Claims (Blocking)

**When to activate:** PR has `[Performance]` prefix, or PR body contains quantitative perf/accuracy claims (latency, throughput, VRAM, speedup, accuracy metrics), or Step 5 flagged missing benchmarks.

**Load** [references/perf-verification.md](references/perf-verification.md).

**Workflow:**

1. Detect claims — extract numbers from PR body using regex patterns
2. Detect hardware — run hardware detection to determine available GPU/VRAM/platform
3. Check feasibility — compare estimated model size (weights + KV cache + overhead) against available VRAM
4. Generate benchmark plan — map PR type to appropriate benchmark runner
5. **Pre-execution gate** — present benchmark plan, estimated duration, and model/hardware to user; ask for confirmation before executing
6. Execute (if confirmed) — run before/after benchmarks via git worktrees, with a **20-minute hard timeout** per run
7. Report — produce Claimed vs Measured table with CONFIRMED / NOT_CONFIRMED verdict

**Graceful degradation:**

| Level | Condition | What happens |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Full verification | GPU available, model fits | Run before/after benchmarks |
| Partial verification | GPU available, model needs offload | Run with `--cpu-offload-gb`, note in report |
| Static-only | No GPU or model too large | Analyze benchmark scripts in diff for correctness, flag implausible claims |
| Skip | No relevant perf claims | Do not activate |

**Delivery:** Local report first, ask user before posting as PR comment. If verification reveals a confirmed NOT_CONFIRMED for accuracy or VRAM regression, escalate to REQUEST_CHANGES via Step 8.

### Step 7: Evaluate Test Quality (Blocking)

**When to activate:** PR adds or modifies test files, or PR touches core code (`engine/`, `stages/`, `connectors/`) without adding tests, or PR is test-only.

**Load** [references/test-quality-evaluation.md](references/test-quality-evaluation.md).

**Workflow:**

1. Static analysis (always runs) — check assertion quality, anti-patterns, marker compliance, edge case coverage
2. Detect hardware — same detection as Step 6 (cross-referenced from `perf-verification.md`)
3. Find affected tests — map changed source files to test files via grep (not path convention)
4. Filter by hardware — skip tests requiring unavailable resources
5. Run tests — `pytest` with `--run-level core_model` by default; use `advanced_model` only if hardware is sufficient
6. Categorize failures — test bug / code bug / infrastructure / flaky
7. Assess quality — score assertion quality, edge case coverage, marker compliance, anti-patterns (A-D grades for internal analysis)

**Graceful degradation:**

| Level | Condition | What happens |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Full analysis | Hardware matches test markers | Static + runtime execution |
| Static-only | Hardware doesn't match or no GPU | Static analysis only; report which tests were skipped |

**Delivery:** Local assessment first, ask user before posting. Convert worst 1-2 findings to inline comments (counts against comment budget). If D-grade dimension or code bug found, escalate to REQUEST_CHANGES via Step 8.

### Step 8: Final Verdict

Post inline comments directly to GitHub as you find them. Do **not** submit a review event (APPROVE / COMMENT / REQUEST_CHANGES) — leave the verdict decision to the user.

Summarize locally:
- What was validated
- What still lacks evidence
- Recommended verdict (local presentation only)

Recommended verdict mapping:

- `APPROVE` — no blockers; body optional (empty is fine).
- `COMMENT` — suggestions only; body optional (~50% should be empty).
- `REQUEST_CHANGES` — genuine blocking issues only (crashes, data loss, security, policy gates).

## Review Heuristics

Trust PR description and CI evidence before demanding new tests. Prefer regression tests for `[Bugfix]`, contract tests for API changes, and scan engine → connectors → stages → entrypoints before peripheral files. Skip style nits unless they mask correctness.

## When to Fetch More Context

Fetch more context when:
- The diff snippet hides lifecycle or cleanup behavior
- A config key or API field is introduced without nearby validation
- A benchmark claim references unseen measurement code
- The PR appears to rely on prior design discussion

Keep additional fetches narrow and tied to a specific uncertainty.

## Diffusion Model PR Review

**When:** Title prefix `[Model]`, `[New Model]`, `[Image]`, `[ImageGen]`, `[Video]`, `[VideoGen]`, or `[Diffusion]`, or a new diffusion model path under `vllm_omni/diffusion/`.

**Load** [references/diffusion-checklist.md](references/diffusion-checklist.md) instead of expanding the full workflow here: Dimensions 1–4 (including optional canonical PR body template + measurement guidance for Dimension 1), `gh`/`grep` detection commands, **Quick Red Flags**, combined-feature rules.

**Gate order before approve:** PR body evidence (script, samples, latency, VRAM) → offline **and** online paths → at least one acceleration **and** one memory optimization (new models) → docs tables + usage examples → required e2e online test → offline test if no e2e → combined test when 2+ accel/memory features.

Use Quick Red Flags actions for comment severity; write human-shaped GitHub comments, not giant pasted templates.
